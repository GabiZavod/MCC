## What is this tool?

The main purpose of this tool is to find and calculate some metrics, based on which we hope to find some distinguishing aspects of human and so called superguman translations. The initial metrics are the following:
- percentage of untranslated words (excluding proper nouns and stop words)
- percentage of ech word class
- lexical density
- type-token ratio
- percentage of passives
